- First i added the sql script in the folder to make you able to establish our database then dealing with it ,
	how ? 
	1 - open the workbench .
	2 - make new scheme named (java-project).
	3 - use the sql script(db2.sql) to create all tables .
	4 - ensure that the connection has been created between the database and the java project .

- After making these steps you can test all classes and the database will be affected .

- If you want test without the database you can use the entity classes in the main 
	without using the DAO classes .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I added these three classes (Entity , DTO , DAO ) for each class , to separate the dealing with the database and make all classes safe while transferring from one place to another.

DTO (Data Transfer Object) Class: Should contain only data members and their associated getters and setters. No business logic or methods that perform actions should be included here.

Entity Class: Can include business logic methods, behavior specific to the entity, and overridden methods for string representation.

DAO (Data Access Object) Class: Contains methods for database interactions, such as CRUD operations.
